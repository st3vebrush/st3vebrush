# 👋 Hello, I'm Stéphane (@st3vebrush)

## Experienced | DevOps | Fullstack Dev | SysAdmin

With over 15 years in the tech industry, I've developed extensive expertise in creating robust infrastructures and optimizing development processes. My journey has led me to design distributed architectures that operate 24/7, automate complex deployments, and develop high-performance applications.

### 🚀 My Journey

I started as a fullstack developer before moving into DevOps, interested in optimizing the entire application lifecycle. This dual expertise gives me a comprehensive view of projects, from design to production.

For nearly 7 years, I led Iridium's blockchain infrastructure, where I took on the challenge of maintaining permanent availability on a distributed architecture. This experience taught me the importance of resilience and traceability in critical environments.

Today, through D3velopment, I design custom solutions that combine performance, security, and sustainability.

### 💡 What Interests Me

- **Building lasting architectures**: I create infrastructures that withstand the test of time and scaling challenges.
- **Automating the automatable**: Implementing CI/CD pipelines that free teams from repetitive tasks.
- **Optimizing performance**: Tracking bottlenecks and improving response times.
- **Developing eco-responsible solutions**: Reducing the environmental footprint of infrastructures while optimizing costs.

### 🛠️ My Toolbox

Over the years, I've refined my mastery of numerous tools:

**Infrastructure & DevOps**: Docker, Ansible, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Proxmox, Linux (Debian)  
**Monitoring**: ELK Stack, Grafana, Zabbix  
**Development**: C++, PHP (Symfony), Python (Flask), JavaScript (Next.js, SvelteKit)  
**Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch

### 🌱 My Professional Philosophy

> "When facing technical challenges, I commit to systematically seeking optimal and sustainable solutions."

This methodical approach, combined with an eco-responsible development approach, structures my daily work. I believe that technical excellence lies in the balance between performance, maintainability, and the reasonable use of resources.
